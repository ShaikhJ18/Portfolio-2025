Recently, I've been thinking deeply about how much of our day-to-day life is spent looking at a screen. Although technology has become a crucial part of our lives—whether it's for school, work, or business—we often use these commitments as an excuse to spend ridiculous amounts of time on things that ultimately don’t bring us closer to our goals or leave us feeling fulfilled.

We tend to convince ourselves that we are being productive by binging tutorials or consuming short-form content, believing that we're benefiting ourselves. In reality, this often leaves us mentally exhausted, tired, and with only shallow, general knowledge about the topics we think we’re learning.

We need to realize something very important before it’s too late: time is your most precious resource, and it is finite. We all know this, but when we take a step back to audit our own technology habits, we’ll often find that much of the time we spent online ended up leaving us feeling empty. That's because we didn’t make any meaningful progress toward our goals.

I encourage everyone to take a step back and reflect deeply on how they are spending their lives. Budget your time wisely, and make sure it’s being spent meaningfully—whether that’s building your career, improving your health, spending quality time with family, or developing a new passion
