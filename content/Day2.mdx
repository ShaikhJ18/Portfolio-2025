Ever since I began attending post-secondary, I’ve started seeing the world through a different lens. The post-COVID-19 era has left many people in my age group disconnected from what’s real and what’s complete fantasy. Online self-help gurus and false promises are thriving off this niche of uncertainty and desperation.

These individuals sell a dream—usually a “get rich quick” hook that resonates with people who are unsure about their future and hungry for financial freedom. I’ve seen people genuinely believe that buying an online course from a stranger will somehow make them a millionaire.

**"Financial freedom"** is a buzzword thrown around constantly in these circles. But most of the time, it’s just bait for the desperate.

There’s a deeper issue we don’t talk about enough: why do so many fall for this?

The truth is, **success is not a highlight reel**, and there’s no such thing as a true get-rich-quick path. Even if you did suddenly become a millionaire, without the right mindset and habits, you’d likely burn through that money in no time—because your behaviors haven’t changed. You’re still operating with a consumer mindset, not a wealth-building one.

**Real wealth is built slowly**—with patience, discipline, and a long-term vision.

There’s a powerful mindset shift that needs to happen:  
Do you want to **have** a million dollars, or do you want to **spend** a million dollars?

That small distinction changes everything. It influences how you make decisions, how you spend, and how you approach your goals. People who want to *spend* a million are often chasing a lifestyle, not actual wealth. And that mindset is exactly what lotteries, gambling, and online scams feed on.

They all profit off the same idea: getting rich quickly with little to no effort.

But here’s the reality: **success is messy**. It’s not a polished 30-second TikTok clip. It’s late nights, rejections, stress, and slow, steady progress.

In the end, it’s your choice. Everyone is free to do what they believe is best for them. But the real question is:

> **Do you want to do the hard work that success requires—or bet everything on a shortcut that might never come?**
